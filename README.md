# Introduction
(This is a script to help you go to sleep soundly, oh wait, no, that's not true.)

This is a script to shutdown the computer after a current time, and prevent the computer from going suspended or turnning off the power automatically.

# Install
Put the script in somewhere handy so that you can start it easily~

# Supported Operation
+ Start the script
```bash
gosleep-mode [timeleft-to-shutdown-in-minutes]
```
+ Abort shutdown schedule when script is running
```bash
Input command > abort|cancel|a|c
```
Notice that it's supposed not to close the terminal window, or you may not be able to cancel the shutdown schedule. This bug may be fixed in the next version, with service control.
